# ðŸš€ Code Challenge!

Create an express application that serves up a static index.html page. 

Research and use jQuery's `$.get`, `$.post`, and `$.ajax` for the following:

# GET

When a user visits '/'
  - Show a button with the text "Get User"

When a user clicks "Get User"
  - Perform an AJAX GET request to '/user'

When the server receives the GET request to '/user'
  - Return a JSON response with the key "data"

  If successful
  ```
  {
    "data": {
      "name": "Toby"
    }
  }
  ```
  
When the Client receives the JSON response
  - Append the name to DOM.

# POST

When a user visits '/numbers.html'
  - Serve a static page
  - Provide an input field to enter text.
  - Provide a button with a click event handler.

When a user enters a series of numbers separated by commas and clicks the button.
  - Perform an AJAX POST request to '/calc'
  - Inlude the comma separated numbers in the body of the request

When the server receives the POST request to '/calc'
  - Read the body of the request
  - Sum the numbers
  - Return a JSON response with a "data" or "error" key

  If successful
  ```
  {
    "data": {
      "answer": 6
    }
  }
  ```

  If unsuccessful - the request doesn't include more than one number
  ```
  {
    "error": {
      "code": 404,
      "message": "Please include a comma separated list of numbers"
    }
  }
  ```

When the Client receives the JSON response
  - Append the answer to DOM.
